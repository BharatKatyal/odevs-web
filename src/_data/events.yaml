          This will be a good introduction for anyone with minimal experience using Kubernetes or AWS.
          Bharat will be helping us follow: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/quickstart.html
          Prerequisites 
          Bring your laptop and register for an AWS account.
          o Preinstall kubectl.
          o Preinstall aws api.
          o Preinstall eksctl.
          o Preinstall helm.
          o Preinstall Docker Desktop, just in case you are having trouble with AWS (Mac, Linux, Windows).

          We will be using EKS, Helm, and kubectl to set up a loadbalancer and a webapp on EKS to play 2048.

          What Makes an AI App Successful?

          How to tell if it IS the network!
          Practical troubleshooting for public facing web applications. We'll go through how to validate DNS, CDN, and Reverse Proxies then determine where the break is via a live demo. Attendants should leave with some useful shell commands and good understanding of the systems that front many public facing services.
